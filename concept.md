# verifiablelab main concepts

Don’t trust - verify!  

The key concept is verifiability and auditing of data, code, algos, protocols, solutions, etc.  

What does this verifiability really mean and why does it matter?  

Just open source isn’t enough. The cost of an error is very high.  

Verifiability means that anyone is able to audit and verify any solution from the ground up.  
No super skills required.  

We should define new standards in industry to avoid past and future failures and bugs.  
Solution providers should prove that solutions are correct, fault tolerant, secure.  
All risks must be defined and quantitatively evaluated.  

Let’s consider smart contracts. The codebase is fairly small and human-verifiable.  
Plus of course verifiable by auto tools. Why not use this practice for everything?  

Verification methodology isn’t complex and can be used by anyone. Checklists are simple but efficient.
